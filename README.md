- This will probably be organized soon...
- This was all of my data and models for my research. 

## Small Introduction from resarch paper
" This study analyzes the effects of COVID-19 on consumer uncertainty. Consumer uncertainty can influence economic cycles via their effects on consumption, borrowing, and investment. This study measures that uncertainty using the Consumer Confidence Index (CCI), an important forward-looking economic indicator used to forecast consumption and other economic variables. It is derived from surveys of households’ current and future expectations of various economic conditions (labor markets, spending attitudes, finances, inflation, …etc. (Freese 2019). The Conference Board releases the CCI on the last Tuesday of each month, and the last reading for October 2022 stood at 102.5. The CCI is indexed to equal 100 in 1985. Hence, a monthly reading of 100 points implies that consumers are as optimistic as they were on average in 1985.  In general, readings above 100 reflect optimism, and readings below 100 indicate pessimism." (Freese 12/2022)
